============================
NOTE FOR UPGRADING JOURNALED
============================

If you are upgrading from an older `journaled` version, please be sure to
increment only ONE major version at a time.

⚠️ IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 3.1 OR EARLIER, you should NOT USE THIS VERSION. ⚠️

Instead, install a version of the gem that is backwards compatible with your
app's currently-enqueued journaled jobs:

gem 'journaled', '~> 4.2.0' # upgrading from 3.0-3.1
gem 'journaled', '~> 3.1.0' # upgrading from 2.0-2.5

For additional upgrade instructions (e.g. how to handle a few BREAKING CHANGES
to environment variables), please see the README:
